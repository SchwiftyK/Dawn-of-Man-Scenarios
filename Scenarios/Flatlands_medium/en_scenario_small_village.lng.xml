	<string name="small_village_welcome_description">Welcome to the small village project. Let's see what you can do with a handful of people (~25). Finally an opportunity to know all your villagers by name.
You don't have any buildings yet. Tell your people to grab the skins and some nuts at their feet and send them to the best place for a settlement.
(b)Enable primal vision(/b) mode, using menu button or pressing (primal_vision_key). Look where all the resources (flint, water, sticks, ore, and so on) are close together and build your village there.
If you like it, give it a thumbs up in the workshop! Have fun!
