A deep gorge in the middle of the mountains with a fertile valley. You will never leave it, but others will surely find their way to you. Probably more than your little village can handle.</string>
	<string name="claustrophobic_welcome_title">Good choice. Enjoy!</string>
	<string name="claustrophobic_welcome_description">Welcome to the claustrophobic village project. Let's see what you can do with a bunch of people and no space. Challenge: Know all your villagers by name.
You don't have any buildings yet. Tell your people to grab the skins and some nuts at their feet and send them to the best place for a settlement.
(b)Enable primal vision(/b) mode, using menu button or pressing (primal_vision_key). Look where all the resources (flint, water, sticks, ore, and so on) are close together and build your village there.
If you like it, give it a thumbs up in the workshop! Have fun!
